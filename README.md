# Language Detection LLM

## Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning a language detection model using data from Hugging Face and Kaggle. The model is built upon the base model provided by Eleldar.

## Base Model

The foundation of this project is the pre-trained language detection model by Eleldar, available [here](https://huggingface.co/eleldar/language-detection). This robust model serves as a solid starting point for our fine-tuning process.

## Data Collection

To enhance the model's performance and accuracy, we have gathered a diverse dataset from two reliable sources:
- **Hugging Face:** A platform offering a wide range of datasets and models for NLP tasks.
- **Kaggle:** A popular data science community providing datasets, competitions, and collaboration opportunities.
